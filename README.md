# Paritii AI Equity Framework and Toolkit for ML/AI Development
Building AI solutions requires a comprehensive toolkit encompassing various tools, libraries, frameworks, and platforms. In this GitHub repo, Paritii AI has created a zoo of
predevelopment considerations, development, production, and post-production processes that incorporate bias and equity considerations in the entire AI/ML lifecycle. Developers
wishing to develop bias-aware ML/AI products can follow the guidelines, code, and technical documentation in this repository's project lifecycle.
