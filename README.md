# Paritii AI Equity Framework and Toolkit for ML/AI Development
This guide is designed to assist Educational Technology leaders and developers in creating more inclusive and equitable AI for higher education. It begins by defining key concepts like equity, trust, accountability, and responsibility in the context of AI in EdTech. It then examines how bias impacts equity and how addressing it can improve student outcomes, institutional metrics, and the vendor's profitability. It offers a comprehensive roadmap for ensuring equity is infused throughout the entire machine learning pipeline, complete with rationale, resources, sample code, examples, and tools that can be easily implemented by project teams and developers.

Building AI solutions requires a comprehensive toolkit encompassing various tools, libraries, frameworks, and platforms. In this GitHub repo, Paritii AI has created a zoo of predevelopment considerations, development, production, and post-production processes that incorporate bias and equity considerations in the entire AI/ML lifecycle.
Developers wishing to develop bias-aware ML/AI products can follow the guidelines, code, and technical documentation in this repository's project lifecycle. 
Junior developers can start with the Demo Notebook which introduces a practical Ml/AI use case.
