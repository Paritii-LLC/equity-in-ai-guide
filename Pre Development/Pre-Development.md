# Pre-Development
For complete information, practical guides and resources on pre-development please visit our website(link). 

The pre-development phase is foundational for cultivating responsible AI practices. By beginning here and focusing on equity during this phase, you will lay the groundwork for building systems that prioritize fairness and inclusivity, essential values for the responsible advancement of AI technology. Pre-development considerations include:

* Purpose and Ideation: (link to section)
 Learn to lead your team in defining goals, problem statements, and use cases that address the root causes of issues you intend to solve with your AI solution while avoiding unintended harm and promoting equitable outcomes.
* Stakeholder Engagement: (link to section) 
Learn how to collaborate authentically with the stakeholders that influence and will be affected by the solution to develop an AI system responsive to the stakeholdersâ€™ needs and unique experiences.
* Infrastructure Assessment: (link to section) 
Learn about the ingredients for successful development and implementation and how to guide your team through an organizational and infrastructure assessment before development begins
* Risk and Fairness:  (link to section) 
Learn how to assess the readiness and risk associated with the development of your AI solution and make important decisions about fairness and bias that influence how your solution promotes equity

## Purpose and Ideation
The purpose and ideation phase sets the direction and foundation for your AI solution, aligning it to the needs of those most impacted by its outputs. Considering equity throughout the ideating activities (defining the problem, setting goals, and aligning use cases) creates the conditions for an AI system that prioritizes fairness, inclusivity, and transparency.
### Problem Definition
AI solutions are complex and often costly to develop and implement. Engaging in problem definition before developing an AI solution ensures alignment with stakeholders' needs, prevents solution bias, and enables the creation of effective and meaningful solutions that address the root causes of the problem while keeping costs within budget.  From an equity standpoint, a well-defined problem statement that recognizes the existing strengths and identifies opportunities to build on them helps mitigate the risk of biases and misuse of AI outputs while centering the experience and needs of those most impacted by the solution. Problem statements should address root causes to focus efforts on resolving underlying issues to prevent wasted resources and avoid exacerbating existing equity gaps over time. 
### Goal Setting and Approach
The goal-setting process lays the groundwork for success, contextualizing the goals for the AI solution within the broader organizational goals to help clarify distinct use cases for the solution. In aligning goal-setting with broader institutional objectives, goals should be mapped to AI solution objectives at all levels, catering to various stakeholder groups. Clear goals drive the institution's strategy and theory of change, leading to the identification of relevant use cases. 
### Use Case Definition
The use cases defined during the purpose and ideation phase of development will guide decision-making throughout the development and implementation phases.  Beyond development, clearly defined use cases enable transparent stakeholder engagement, enhance the explainability of the solution, and allow for continuous evaluation of the project. Defining use cases involves exploring all possible ways that AI can address the goals and strategies defined during goal-setting while being mindful of preventing outputs from causing unintended harm.

## Stakeholder Engagement
Stakeholder mapping within AI development involves identifying and analyzing the individuals or groups with influence, vested interests, and direct or indirect impact on creating and implementing an AI system.  For both technical and non-technical individuals, understanding the dynamics and interests of stakeholders is crucial for aligning AI development with ethical standards, legal requirements, and societal expectations. An efficient stakeholder engagement strategy includes mapping out what kind of feedback to request from whom and when to engage with the various stakeholders.

## Infrastructure Assessment
An organization seeking to build or implement an AI/ML system needs to conduct an infrastructure assessment to determine what it will need to build an AI/ML system successfully. The infrastructure refers to hardware and software components for building and training AI models. Components like specialized processors like GPUs (hardware) and optimization and deployment tools (software) fall under the infrastructure umbrella. Developers developing AI systems at the start of their development operations (Dev-Ops) need to consider the following questions when developing their strategy for infrastructure assessment.
* Data Availability and Quality: Assess the organization's data's availability, quality, and relevance. Ensure it has enough high-quality data to train AI models and derive meaningful insights 
* Data Governance: Establish a data governance framework not only at an organizational level. In the specific context of AI project development, developers should also develop a stringent data governance framework that outlines data collection, storage, usage, and protection practices. Address privacy, security, and ethical concerns associated with AI/ML adoption 
* Infrastructure and Resources: Evaluate the organization's existing IT infrastructure and computing resources. The organization needs to determine if it has the necessary hardware, software, and storage capabilities to support AI/ML workloads effectively depending on the applications being considered
* Validation and Testing Framework: Develop a logical framework for validation and testing. Ensure that the framework allows for rigorous verification of the project's components and the overall solution and includes logical consistency checks, performance evaluations, and user acceptance testing.
* Knowledge Integration and Documentation: Ensure a logical structure for integrating knowledge and insights gained during the project. Develop comprehensive documentation that outlines the project's components, workflows, and decision-making processes.
