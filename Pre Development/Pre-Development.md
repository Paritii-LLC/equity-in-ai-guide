## Purpose and Ideation
The purpose and ideation phase sets the direction and foundation for your AI solution, aligning it to the needs of those most impacted by its outputs. Considering equity throughout the ideating activities (defining the problem, setting goals, and aligning use cases) creates the conditions for an AI system that prioritizes fairness, inclusivity, and transparency.
### Problem Definition
AI solutions are complex and often costly to develop and implement. Engaging in problem definition before developing an AI solution ensures alignment with stakeholders' needs, prevents solution bias, and enables the creation of effective and meaningful solutions that address the root causes of the problem while keeping costs within budget.  From an equity standpoint, a well-defined problem statement that recognizes the existing strengths and identifies opportunities to build on them helps mitigate the risk of biases and misuse of AI outputs while centering the experience and needs of those most impacted by the solution. Problem statements should address root causes to focus efforts on resolving underlying issues to prevent wasted resources and avoid exacerbating existing equity gaps over time. 
### Goal Setting and Approach
The goal-setting process lays the groundwork for success, contextualizing the goals for the AI solution within the broader organizational goals to help clarify distinct use cases for the solution. In aligning goal-setting with broader institutional objectives, goals should be mapped to AI solution objectives at all levels, catering to various stakeholder groups. Clear goals drive the institution's strategy and theory of change, leading to the identification of relevant use cases. 
### Use Case Definition
The use cases defined during the purpose and ideation phase of development will guide decision-making throughout the development and implementation phases.  Beyond development, clearly defined use cases enable transparent stakeholder engagement, enhance the explainability of the solution, and allow for continuous evaluation of the project. Defining use cases involves exploring all possible ways that AI can address the goals and strategies defined during goal-setting while being mindful of preventing outputs from causing unintended harm.

## Stakeholder Engagement
Once you have identified stakeholders and their motivations and mapped levels of influence and impact, the next step is to create a plan of engagement to ensure diverse perspectives are considered throughout the development process. Stakeholder mapping within AI development involves identifying and analyzing the individuals or groups with influence, vested interests, and direct or indirect impact on creating and implementing an AI system.  For both technical and non-technical individuals, understanding the dynamics and interests of stakeholders is crucial for aligning AI development with ethical standards, legal requirements, and societal expectations. An efficient stakeholder engagement strategy includes mapping out what kind of feedback to request from whom and when to engage with the various stakeholders.

## Infrastructure Assessment
An organization seeking to build or implement an AI/ML system needs to conduct an infrastructure assessment to determine what it will need to build an AI/ML system successfully. The infrastructure refers to hardware and software components for building and training AI models. Components like specialized processors like GPUs (hardware) and optimization and deployment tools (software) fall under the infrastructure umbrella. 

At the beginning of their development operations (Dev-Ops), developers need to consider the following questions when developing their strategy for infrastructure assessment.
* Data Availability and Quality: Assess the organization's data's availability, quality, and relevance. Ensure it has enough high-quality data to train AI models and derive meaningful insights 
* Data Governance: Establish a data governance framework not only at an organizational level. In the specific context of AI project development, developers should also develop a stringent data governance framework that outlines data collection, storage, usage, and protection practices. Address privacy, security, and ethical concerns associated with AI/ML adoption 
* Infrastructure and Resources: Evaluate the organization's existing IT infrastructure and computing resources. The organization needs to determine if it has the necessary hardware, software, and storage capabilities to support AI/ML workloads effectively depending on the applications being considered
* Validation and Testing Framework: Develop a logical framework for validation and testing. Ensure that the framework allows for rigorous verification of the project's components and the overall solution and includes logical consistency checks, performance evaluations, and user acceptance testing.
* Knowledge Integration and Documentation: Ensure a logical structure for integrating knowledge and insights gained during the project. Develop comprehensive documentation that outlines the project's components, workflows, and decision-making processes.

## Risk and Fairness
In an era where technology intertwines with every facet of life, AI has risen as a key transformative force across various industries. However, this progress also introduces a critical challenge: the emergence and persistence of biases in AI systems. Grasping the nuances of these biases benefits developers, product managers, administrators, policymakers, and even end-users, given their impact extends beyond technical inaccuracies to include statistical errors and societal prejudices. Unchecked, these biases can foster inequality if not adequately addressed; they impact everything from employment opportunities to judicial fairness, healthcare access, and the quality of education. The complexity of AI bias underscores the need for a broad awareness of its impacts. Such knowledge empowers individuals to advocate for equitable and just AI systems, ensuring technology catalyzes positive change, enhances societal well-being, and bridges divides.
* Technical Bias: This refers to the accuracy and precision of AI models. Technical biases, like high bias leading to underfitting or high variance leading to overfitting, affect a model's performance. They arise from the model's inability to capture the complexities of real-world data or its excessive sensitivity to training data.
* Societal Bias: Far more insidious, societal biases reflect existing prejudices and inequalities. These biases, often ingrained in the data AI models are trained on, can mirror and amplify systemic racism and discrimination.

To effectively mitigate biases, we should thoroughly understand the interplay of human judgment and systemic factors within the machine learning pipeline, thereby adopting an approach that thoughtfully incorporates both aspects.


###  Fairness
Machine learning fairness is often evaluated using three statistical measures: independence, separation, and sufficiency, each addressing different aspects of bias and fairness. Understanding these principles of fairness is vital for individuals even beyond the tech sphere, as it aids in fostering responsible technology use and shaping policies that reflect ethical standards. This understanding enables a wider conversation on crafting AI systems that are both technologically advanced and socially responsible, emphasizing the collective role in steering technology toward outcomes that are equitable and representative of all societal segments.
* Independence: This measure examines the relationship between the predicted outcome, the actual outcome, and the membership group to mitigate bias in algorithms. Independence is achieved when the predicted outcome is not influenced by group membership. 
* Separation: While independence does not consider actual outcomes, separation incorporates the actual outcomes of the algorithm. It requires that the rates of correct and incorrect predictions are equal across different demographic groups. This approach is related to concepts like predictive parity and equalized odds, focusing on maintaining consistent true positive and false negative rates across groups. 
* Sufficiency (Calibration by Group): Sufficiency emphasizes the accuracy of predictions within diverse groups, ensuring that the forecasted probabilities match the actual outcomes. However, achieving sufficiency and separation simultaneously is challenging, especially when the prevalence of the target variable differs between groups. Striving for calibration or predictive parity might lead to disparities in false positives or negatives, creating different impacts across groups.
