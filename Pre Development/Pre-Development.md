# Rubric: AI Equity Rubric Guidelines for Developers
The pre-development phase is foundational for cultivating responsible AI practices. By beginning here and focusing on equity during this phase, you will lay the groundwork for building systems that prioritize fairness and inclusivity, essential values for the responsible advancement of AI technology. Pre-development considerations include:

## Purpose and Ideation: (link to section) Learn to lead your team in defining goals, problem statements, and use cases that address the root causes of issues you intend to solve with your AI solution while avoiding unintended harm and promoting equitable outcomes.
## Stakeholder Engagement: (link to section) Learn how to collaborate authentically with the stakeholders that influence and will be affected by the solution to develop an AI system responsive to the stakeholdersâ€™ needs and unique experiences.
## Infrastructure Assessment: (link to section) Learn about the ingredients for successful development and implementation and how to guide your team through an organizational and infrastructure assessment before development begins
## Risk and Fairness:  (link to section) Learn how to assess the readiness and risk associated with the development of your AI solution and make important decisions about fairness and bias that influence how your solution promotes equity

# Infrastructure Assessment
An organization seeking to build or implement an AI/ML system needs to conduct an infrastructure assessment to determine what they need to successfully build an AI/ML system. The infrastructure model consists of hardware and software components that are necessary for building and training AI models. Components such as specialized processors like GPUs (hardware) and optimization and deployment tools (software) fall under the infrastructure umbrella [1]. The following considerations will help organizations and developers navigate the process. 
## Organizations
1.	Big Data Storage: 
This refers to the ability to scale storage as the volume of data grows. The ability to handle storage should be a high priority.  This includes ensuring the proper storage capacity, Input/Output Operations per sec (IOPS) and reliability to deal with the massive data amounts required for effective AI [2]. One important factor to consider is the nature of the source data. AI applications depend on source data, so an organization needs to know where the source data resides and how AI applications will use it [2]. Organizations also need to put in place plans for monitoring and expansion as databases grow over time. Consider Cloud or On-premises solutions. Organizations must decide whether to adopt a cloud-based AI/ML solution or develop an on-premises infrastructure. 
2.	Networking Infrastructure:
The network infrastructure is a key component of the AI/ML system implementation process. To provide the high efficiency at scale required to support AI and machine learning models, organizations will likely need to upgrade their networks [2]. Optimal network infrastructure should have the following key attributes of high-bandwidth, low-latency and elastic architectures that can respond flexibly to computing needs. 
3.	Computing Resources:
It is imperative to have robust computing resources by deciding on the right mix of CPU and GPU chips. CPU-based compute units work best for light AI/ML loads while GPU -based compute units work best for advanced AI/ML workloads and neural network computing [2]. 
4.	Data Management and Governance:
Data management strategy needs to ensure that users -- machines and people -- have easy and fast access to data and it should be accessible from a variety of endpoints, including mobile devices via wireless networks [2]. Privacy and security controls need to be implemented for data access controls to comply with legal regulations about data and privacy protection. Develop a robust data governance framework that outlines data collection, storage, usage, and protection practices. Address privacy, security, and ethical concerns associated with AI/ML adoption [3]

## Developers
5.	Define Clear Objectives:
 Clearly articulate the business objectives you aim to achieve through AI/ML implementation. Identify specific problems or opportunities that can be addressed effectively using these technologies [3]
6.	Evaluate Data Availability and Quality: 
Assess the availability, quality, and relevance of your organization's data. Ensure that you have enough high-quality data to train AI models and derive meaningful insights [3]
7.	Establish Data Governance Framework:
 Develop a stringent data governance framework that outlines data collection, storage, usage, and protection practices. Address privacy, security, and ethical concerns associated with AI/ML adoption [3]
8.	Assess Infrastructure and Resources: 
Evaluate your organization's existing IT infrastructure and computing resources. Determine if you have the necessary hardware, software, and storage capabilities to support AI/ML workloads effectively depending on the application/s been considered [3]

# Logical Assumptions for Pre-Development Considerations
## Logical Foundation Assessment:
An organization or developer planning to initiate a development project should establish a logical foundation, which involves understanding and framing the logical premises and constraints of the project. This includes assessing the logical consistency of the project goals, the feasibility of the approaches, and the alignment of the project with broader organizational objectives. Below are considerations that will guide organizations and developers through this crucial phase.

## Organizations
1. **Goal Alignment and Feasibility:**
   Ensure the project's goals logically align with the organization's overarching objectives and capabilities. Assess the project's feasibility in terms of available resources, technical capabilities, and market conditions. Consider if the project addresses a real and significant problem or opportunity in the organization's context.

2. **Stakeholder Analysis:**
   Conduct a thorough analysis of stakeholders. Understand their needs, expectations, and potential impact on the project. Ensure that the project's objectives are in harmony with the interests of key stakeholders and that there are mechanisms to address any conflicts or concerns.

3. **Risk Assessment and Mitigation:**
   Identify potential risks that could jeopardize the project's success. These risks can be technical, financial, operational, or reputational. Develop a logical risk assessment framework and establish clear risk mitigation and contingency plan strategies.

4. **Resource Allocation and Optimization:**
   Ensure that resources (human, financial, and technological) are allocated optimally to support the project's objectives. Evaluate the logical distribution of resources to avoid over or underutilization and to maximize efficiency and effectiveness.

## Developers
5. **Problem Definition and Solution Mapping:**
   Clearly define the problem that the project aims to solve. Develop a logical mapping between the problem components and the proposed solutions. Ensure that the solution approach is rational, viable, and scalable.

6. **Technology and Methodology Selection:**
   Select technologies and methodologies that suit the project's objectives and organizational context. Assess the logical coherence between the project requirements and the capabilities of the chosen technologies and methodologies.

7. **Validation and Testing Framework:**
   Develop a logical framework for validation and testing. Ensure that the framework allows for rigorous verification of the project's components and the overall solution. This should include logical consistency checks, performance evaluations, and user acceptance testing.

8. **Knowledge Integration and Documentation:**
   Ensure a logical structure for integrating knowledge and insights gained during the project. Develop comprehensive documentation that outlines the project's components, workflows, and decision-making processes.
