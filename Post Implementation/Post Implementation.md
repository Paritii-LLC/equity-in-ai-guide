# Post Implementation
For complete information, practical guides and resources on post implementation please visit our website(link).
In the post-implementation phase, the focus shifts to ensuring that the deployed AI system continues to uphold principles of equity, fairness, transparency, and inclusivity prioritized during development. Recognizing the dynamic nature of artificial intelligence and its potential impact on diverse communities, this stage plays a pivotal role in mitigating biases, fostering AI awareness and literacy, and addressing the evolving needs of users.  From a technical perspective, this phase includes implementing regular audits, performance evaluations, and continuous monitoring to assess the AI system's adherence to ethical guidelines and equitable outcomes.

## AI Literacy, Education, and Awareness Building
AI literacy and end-user education promote the explainability of algorithms by increasing stakeholders' understanding of AI concepts and empowering end-users to engage with AI systems effectively. 
### Model Explainability
Model explainability is specific to the AI system and refers to the ability to provide transparent insights into its decision-making processes, enabling stakeholders, including end-users, to understand and interpret the rationale behind its outputs. Explainability makes AI decisions understandable to individuals who may not have technical expertise, and developers can achieve it in several ways:
* Global Explanations: Provide insights into the overall behavior of the model by analyzing feature importance, model parameters, or feature contributions across the entire dataset.
* Interpretable Models: Use models that inherently provide transparency, such as decision trees, linear regression, or rule-based systems. These models offer clear rules or features that explain their predictions.
* Local Explanations: Techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) generate explanations for individual predictions, making it easier to understand why a specific decision was made.
* Simplification: Simplify complex models using techniques like feature selection, dimensionality reduction, or model distillation, which create more interpretable versions of the original model while preserving its performance.
* Post-hoc Explanations: Utilize methods like feature importance scores, partial dependence plots, or sensitivity analysis to explain the model's predictions after it has been trained.
* Interactive Visualization: Present model explanations through interactive visualizations that allow users to intuitively explore how different features affect predictions and understand the decision-making process.
* Natural Language Generation: Automatically generate human-readable explanations in natural language to describe the reasoning behind model predictions clearly and understandably.
* Ethical Considerations: Consider ethical implications and fairness metrics when designing and explaining AI models, ensuring that explanations reflect the model's adherence to fairness principles and ethical guidelines.
* Documentation and Communication: Provide comprehensive documentation and communication channels to explain the model's purpose, limitations, and potential biases to stakeholders, promoting trust and transparency in its use.

AI literacy and end-user education complement each other in promoting the explainability of algorithms by increasing stakeholders' understanding of AI concepts and empowering end-users to engage with AI systems effectively. A higher level of AI literacy among stakeholders, including administrators, faculty, staff, students, and other stakeholders at an institution, is fundamental to effective solution implementation. Part of planning for successfully implementing an AI solution involves defining a strategy for supporting various stakeholder groups in using the systems and outputs to align with its equitable use case.
