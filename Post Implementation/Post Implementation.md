# Post Implementation
In the post-implementation phase, the focus shifts to ensuring that the deployed AI system continues to uphold principles of equity, fairness, transparency, and inclusivity prioritized during development. Recognizing the dynamic nature of artificial intelligence and its potential impact on diverse communities, this stage plays a pivotal role in mitigating biases, fostering AI awareness and literacy, and addressing the evolving needs of users.  From a technical perspective, this phase includes implementing regular audits, performance evaluations, and continuous monitoring to assess the AI system's adherence to ethical guidelines and equitable outcomes.
