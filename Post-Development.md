# Post Development
# Testing
Testing is a crucial aspect of the machine learning development process, ensuring that models are accurate, reliable, and robust in real-world scenarios. This section covers various strategies, recommendations and guidelines for evaluating algorithms and outputs for bias, dealing with bias, and testing models by conducting impact assessment through simulated tests on synthetic data before model deployment to end users
  ## Evaluate Algorithms and Output for Bias:
Algorithmic bias occurs when AI/ML model design, data, and sampling result in measurably different model performance for different subgroups [1]. The two major courses of algorithmic bias are subgroup invalidity and label choice bias. Subgroup invalidity occurs when AI/ML is predicting an appropriate outcome or measure, but the model does not perform well for particular subgroups [1]. The underlying cause is when AI/ML models are trained on non-diverse populations or with data that underrepresents the subgroup or fails to include specific risk factors affecting them [1]. Label choice bias occurs when the algorithm’s predicted outcome is a proxy variable for the actual outcome it should be predicting [1].

Algorithmic bias has the potential to cause serious harm and even have life-threatening impact on consumers of the output of ML/AI models. Hence, there is a practical need to evaluate algorithms and output for bias. There are a few steps that can be implemented namely[2];

A. Inventory of algorithms - Maintain a detailed inventory of all algorithms being used or developed. Include information such as the purpose, functionality, development stage, and key components. Form a diverse committee comprising internal and external stakeholders, including subject matter experts, data scientists, legal experts, and ethicists. This committee should meet regularly to discuss algorithmic developments, ethical considerations, and potential impacts.

B. Screen each algorithm for bias - Some general steps that you can take to screen algorithms for bias are as follows
      - Define Bias: Clearly define what bias means in the context of your application. Bias can manifest in various ways, such as 
         racial, gender, or socioeconomic bias.
     
      - Diverse Dataset: Ensure that your training dataset is diverse and representative of the population your algorithm is intended to 
        serve. Biased training data can lead to biased models.
      
      - Data Preprocessing: Carefully preprocess and clean the data to remove any existing biases. Be aware of potential biases 
       introduced during data collection or labeling.
      
      - Fair Features: Identify and analyze the features used by the algorithm. Check for any features that may disproportionately 
        impact 
       certain groups and assess their relevance.
     
      - Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits of the algorithm's output to detect any patterns of bias. This includes monitoring for 
       disparate impacts on different demographic groups.
     
      - Bias Metrics: Develop and use specific metrics to measure bias. Metrics such as disparate impact, equalized odds, and 
        demographic parity can help quantify and identify bias.
      
      - Post-Processing Techniques: Implement post-processing techniques to mitigate bias. This can include re-ranking or re-scoring 
        algorithmic outputs to achieve fairness.

On the technical side, python libraries like Aequitas (http://aequitas.dssg.io/) can be used to test for bias in the features and output of the algorithm. Aequitas is an open-source bias audit toolkit for machine learning developers, analysts, and policymakers to audit machine learning models for discrimination and bias, and make informed and equitable decisions around developing and deploying predictive risk-assessment tools [3]

Encourage users to provide feedback on the algorithm's outputs, especially if they believe bias may be present. This feedback loop can be valuable for continuous improvement.

## Mitigating Biases Between vs Within Groups:
In-group bias (also known as in-group favoritism) is the tendency for people to give preferential treatment to others who belong to the same group that they do [1]. Machine learning can also amplify in-group biases. Datasets that train AI software are usually skewed towards one group or against another [1]. 
Mitigating biases between groups and within groups involves addressing both systemic biases that affect different demographic or user groups and biases that arise within specific subgroups. Here are strategies for mitigating biases at both levels:

Biases Between Groups:
- Diverse Representation in Data: Ensure that your training data includes diverse samples from all relevant demographic groups to avoid under-representation or marginalization.

- Fair Sampling: Use techniques such as stratified sampling to ensure that each subgroup is adequately represented in the training data, preventing biases related to group size.

- Demographic-Aware Features: Develop features that are sensitive to demographic differences, ensuring that the algorithm considers and appropriately adjusts for variations between groups.
- Equalized Odds: Implement fairness metrics like equalized odds, which aims to ensure that the algorithm's predictions are equally accurate across different demographic groups.

- Fair Pre-Processing: Apply pre-processing techniques to the data to mitigate biases before training the algorithm, addressing disparities between groups.

- Bias-Aware Algorithms: Use algorithms specifically designed to be aware of and mitigate biases. Fairness-aware machine learning models incorporate fairness constraints during training.


Biases Within Groups:
- Subgroup Analysis: Conduct subgroup analysis to identify biases within specific groups. This involves examining how the algorithm's performance varies across subpopulations.

- Fine-Grained Fairness Metrics: Define and use fine-grained fairness metrics that assess performance within subgroups, ensuring that biases are not perpetuated within specific communities.

- Customized Mitigation Strategies: Develop targeted mitigation strategies for specific subgroups if biases are identified. This could involve adjusting model parameters or implementing custom fairness interventions.

- Localized Training Data: If applicable, consider using localized or customized training data for certain subgroups to address specific cultural or contextual nuances.

- Sensitivity Analysis: Conduct sensitivity analyses to understand how changes in input features affect outcomes within different subgroups. This can help identify and address biases at a granular level.

- User Feedback Loops: Establish feedback mechanisms that allow users to report biases or issues specific to their subgroup. Use this feedback to continuously improve the algorithm.

- Inclusive Design Principles: Incorporate inclusive design principles, involving users from diverse backgrounds in the development process to ensure that the algorithm meets the needs of all user groups.

- Regular Audits: Implement regular audits and evaluations of the algorithm's performance, focusing on both overall fairness and fairness within specific subgroups.
It's important to approach bias mitigation comprehensively, addressing both systemic biases between groups and biases that may exist within specific subgroups. Additionally, involving stakeholders from diverse backgrounds throughout the development process enhances the likelihood of creating fair and unbiased algorithms.

## Evaluating the Balance Between Variance vs Bias in the Outcomes and Adjusting the Trade-offs and Thresholds:
There is a tradeoff between a model’s ability to minimize bias and variance.A proper understanding of these errors would help us not only to build accurate models but also to avoid the mistake of overfitting and underfitting and hence help to mitigate biases in ML models [1]. The trade-off between bias and variance is an important aspect of developing machine learning models. Striking the right balance is essential for creating models that generalize well to new, unseen data. Bias in a mathematical sense in the context of ML refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, and high bias can lead to oversimplification. Variance refers to the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data, and high variance can result in overfitting. There is a trade-off between bias and variance, as you reduce bias, variance tends to increase, and vice versa. Some practical steps that can be used to optimize the bias-variance tradeoff are as follows;

A. Evaluate Model Performance: Assess your model's performance on both training and validation datasets. High bias often results in poor performance on both, while high variance can lead to excellent performance on training data but poor generalization to new data.

B. Learning Curves: Plot learning curves to visualize the model's performance over training iterations. This helps identify whether the model is underfitting or overfitting.

C. Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of your model's performance. It helps in evaluating how well the model generalizes to different subsets of the data.

D. Bias Reduction: If bias is high, consider using more complex models, increasing model capacity, or adding features to capture additional complexity.

E. Variance Reduction: If the variance is high, consider simplifying the model, reducing its complexity, or using regularization techniques.

F. Regularization: Apply regularization techniques (like L1 or L2 regularization) to penalize complex models and prevent overfitting.

G. Feature Engineering: Make a careful choice of features and engineer features to improve the model's ability to capture relevant patterns in the data without introducing noise.

H. Ensemble Methods: Explore ensemble methods like bagging or boosting, which can help reduce variance by combining predictions from multiple models [2]

I. Hyperparameter Tuning: Conduct a systematic grid search to tune hyperparameters to find the optimal balance between bias and variance.

J. Threshold Adjustment: Adjust decision thresholds, especially in classification problems, to control the trade-off between precision and recall.

K. Regular Monitoring: Regularly monitor and re-evaluate your model's performance as data distributions may change over time.

L. Examine Feature Importance: Understand which features contribute the most to the model's predictions. Eliminating irrelevant features can help reduce variance.

  ## Ensure model is human interpretable:
  The simplest way to ensure models are interpretable is to use models which by their design are interpretable[1]. The class of models which are apriori interpretable are Linear regression, logistic regression and decision trees. Neural network models commonly used in deep learning are not by design easily interpretable but techniques exists to ensure interpretability. Interpretability facilitates[2]:
1. Understanding 
2. Debugging and auditing ML model predictions 
3. Bias detection to ensure fair decision making 
4. Robustness checks to ensure that small changes in the input do not lead to large changes in the output 
5. Methods that provide recourse for those who have been adversely affected by model predictions 

Depending on the model complexity, methods for model interpretability can be classified into intrinsic analysis and post hoc analysis.Intrinsic analysis can be applied to interpret models that have low complexity (simple relationships between the input variables and the predictions) while post hoc analysis can be applied to interpret simpler models as well as more complex models, such as neural networks, which have the ability to capture non-linear interactions [2]. These methods are often model-agnostic and provide mechanisms to interpret a trained model based on the inputs and output predictions. Post hoc analysis can be performed at a local level, or at a global level [2]. An AWS white paper provides a detailed explanation of the various techniques for model interpretability and can be accessed here (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/ml-best-practices-healthcare-life-sciences/model-interpretability.html)

# Model Explanation
## Document Potential Biases and Where They Arise:
The documentation of potential biases and understanding where they arise is a crucial step in addressing fairness and ethics in machine learning models. The following structured approach to document potential biases can be applied;

- Document sources of bias in the data collection process (e.g., underrepresentation of certain groups, sampling biases)

- Note any biases introduced by data collection methods (e.g., survey design, data labeling).

- Note any biases introduced by data collection methods (e.g., survey design, data labeling)

- Document preprocessing steps that may inadvertently introduce biases (e.g., normalization, imputation techniques)

- Identify features that may be proxies for sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race) and prone to introducing biases. Document decisions related to the inclusion or exclusion of such features in the model.

- Document the choice of algorithms and their potential biases (e.g., models trained on biased datasets, biased loss functions) and note any hyperparameter settings that may amplify or mitigate biases.

- Document efforts to address class imbalances and potential impacts on model fairness and note any techniques used to mitigate biases during training.

- Document the choice of evaluation metrics and consider whether they are appropriate for all relevant groups and be aware of metrics that may mask disparities or unfairly advantage certain groups.

- Document potential biases that may arise in the deployment environment (e.g., changes in user behavior, evolving data distributions).
Consider any biases introduced during the deployment of models in specific applications

- Document biases that may arise in user feedback and consider their potential impact on model improvement efforts

- Document how the model aligns with ethical guidelines and principles established by the organization and identify ethical concerns and potential societal impacts.

## Explain which Data Features the Model Considers Important and Why Those Were Selected:
 Feature selection is the process of isolating the most consistent, non-redundant, and relevant features to use in model construction [1]. Understanding which data features a model considers important is a key aspect of model interpretability. The importance of features helps users, stakeholders, and data scientists gain insights into the decision-making process of the model.
Some feature importance techniques are;

- Permutation Importance: Assess the impact of shuffling individual features on model performance. If shuffling a feature significantly reduces model performance, that feature is considered important.

- Feature Importance from Tree-Based Models: Tree-based models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting) naturally provide feature importance scores based on the contribution of each feature to the model's splits.

- LASSO (L1 Regularization) Coefficients: In linear models with L1 regularization, the magnitude of the coefficients represents feature importance. Non-zero coefficients indicate important features.

- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): This method iteratively removes the least important features until the desired number is reached, providing a ranking of feature importance.

Optimal feature selection provides greater predictive and explainability power of ML models. Understanding and communicating feature importance contribute to model transparency, interpretability, and trust, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the model's insights.

## Document the Demographics of the Training Dataset:
The documentation the demographics of the training dataset is an important step in understanding potential biases and ensuring transparency in machine learning models. This documentation helps stakeholders, including data scientists, policymakers, and users, gain insights into the representation of different demographic groups in the data. Demographic representativeness in training data and model transparency is necessary to ensure that ML models are deployed in an equitable and reproducible manner. Wider adoption of reporting guidelines is warranted to improve representativeness and reproducibility [1].
A potentially useful guide on how to document the demographics of a training dataset:
1. Identify Relevant Demographic Categories:

- Compare model performance on historical and new data to detect discrepancies or biases.

- Incorporate human reviewers or ethicists to assess potential biases in new datasets or features.

Bias detection is an ongoing process and applying a systematized approach to it ensures the fairness and transparency of AI systems

## Model Comparison with Prior Versions/Versioning/Rollback Mechanisms/Incremental training:
Comparing models with prior versions, implementing versioning, enabling rollback mechanisms, and incorporating incremental training are critical aspects of maintaining and improving machine learning models. These critical aspects need to be integrated into your workflow [1]. The following scheme can be followed in your data science workstream[1];

1. Model Comparison with Prior Versions:

Leverage transfer learning techniques to adapt pre-trained models to new data domains or tasks efficiently.

5. A/B Testing and Experimentation:

Controlled Experiments:
Conduct A/B tests to compare the performance of new model versions against baseline or existing models.
Use experimentation frameworks to systematically evaluate changes and iterate on model improvements.

6. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):

Automated Pipelines:
Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate model training, testing, and deployment processes.
Ensure that each code commit triggers automated tests and validation checks before deployment.

# Output Adjustment & Interpretation
## Potential Impact Assessment of Output:
It is imoprtant to practically test the output of a machine learning model prior to human interpretation. There are three testing methods that can be used, namely [1];

1. Invariance Test - The invariance test defines input changes that are expected to leave model outputs unaffected. A common method for testing invariance is related to data augmentation. You pair up modified and unmodified input examples and see how much this affects the model output.
2. Directional Expectation Test - A directional expectation test is a test which is run to check hpw a change in the input distribution changes the expected output. An example is  testing assumptions about the number of bathrooms or property size when predicting house prices. A higher number of bathrooms should mean a higher price prediction. Seeing a different result might reveal wrong assumptions about the relationship between our input and output or the distribution of our dataset.
3. Minimum Functionality Test - The minimum functionality test helps you decide whether individual model components behave as expected. The reasoning behind these tests is that overall, output-based performance can conceal critical upcoming issues in your model. A few ways to do this are, create samples that are “very easy” for the model to predict, in order to see if they consistently deliver these types of predictions; test data segments and subsets that meet a specific criteria; test for failure modes you have identified during manual error analysis.

## Monitor Results and Contextualize Results:
Monitoring and contextualizing results in the context of machine learning models are crucial steps for understanding model performance, identifying potential issues, and making informed data-driven decisions. The following blueprint can be used as a guide in this stage of the ML development  and productionization process. 

1. Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- Relevant Metrics:
Define KPIs based on project goals and objectives, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or business-specific metrics.

2. Establish Baselines and Thresholds:

- Baseline Performance:
Set baseline values for each KPI to compare against model performance.

- Thresholds:
Define acceptable ranges or thresholds for KPIs based on business requirements, regulatory constraints, or industry standards.

3. Continuous Monitoring:

## Avoid Bias Evolving in the Learning Model Over Time:
 Bias in machine learning models refers to systematic errors introduced by algorithms or training data that lead to unfair or disproportionate predictions for specific groups or individuals [1]. Such biases can arise due to historical imbalances in the training data, algorithm design, or data collection process [1]. You avoid bias evolving in the ML model over time by assesing several metrics and methodologies used to assess bias namely [1];
- Disparate Impact Analysis: This technique examines the disparate impact of an AI model's decisions on different demographic groups. It measures the difference in model outcome for various groups and highlights potential biases.
- Fairness Metrics: Different fairness metrics have been developed to measure bias in machine learning models. Key examples include Equal Opportunity Difference, Disparate Misclassification Rate, and Treatment Equality. These metrics help assess how fairly the model treats different groups. 
- Post-hoc Analysis: This involves examining an AI system’s decisions after deployment to identify instances of bias and understand its impact on users and society.

## Versioning and Proper Documentation on Model Design and Implications:
Versioning management tools like Github and Bitbucket exist to manage software development versioning and documentation. Machine learning models which are basically a complex ecosystem of data, algorithms and code also require versioning and documentation. Version Control is the process of tracking and managing software changes over time. Whether you’re building an app or an ML model, you need to track every modification done by members of the software team to fix bugs and avoid conflicts [1]. The machine learning development process requires a lot of iterative work, where the developers and Data Scientists are searching for the best performing model while changing hyperparameters, code, and data. It is therefore important to keep a history of these changes to track model performance relative to the parameters, which saves you the time you would spend retraining the model for experimentation or deployment purposes [1]. 

Machine learning version control has three parts [1]:

A. Code
There is modelling code and implementation code. Modelling code is used to implement the model, and implementation code is used for inference. They can both be written in different programming languages, but it might make it more difficult to maintain all of your code and dependencies. 

B. Data
There is metadata, which is information about your data and model. Then there is the actual data, the datasets that you use to train and run your model. Metadata can change without any change in the data, and versioning should link the data to the appropriate meta information

C. Model
The model is the glue that connects all of the above with model parameters and hyperparameters to produce a finished product.

Versioning models and data creates a framework for better monitoring of the models. In addition, versioning serves as an accelerator on how frequently the models can be updated and placed in production [2]. With proper versioning and documentation, we can combine model predictions and the corresponding input data with model versions and trained data. With this kind of logical grouping, we can eventually detect data drifts and model miss performances which then allow for better model retraining and troubleshooting [2].
More information about version and proper documentation can be found in this excellent resource here (https://neptune.ai/blog/version-control-for-ml-models)

## Data Retention and Deletion Strategy for Handling Ethical and Privacy Issues:
Data retention is the storing of information for a specific period of time. It helps businesses reduce costs, legal risks, and security threats to users and organizations [1]. To successfully implement a data retention policy, incoming and existing data needs to be properly classified and organized based on its risk level and intended use [1]. The data retention policy needs to indicate who and which departments are responsible for the retention and disposal of each data type in the data ecosystem. The policy should also state what needs to happen at the end of the retention period [1]. Many global privacy regulations have demanded that organizations and instituitions make data deletion a common practice, rather than just a best practice [2]. There are two types of data deletion processes required by privacy regulations namely request-based deletion and data retention and purge [2]. Request-based deletion is initiated  when someone initiates a data deletion request. The individual's status and relationship with the organization determine whether the request must be honored, what type of data can be deleted upon the request, and whether any exceptions to deletion requirements apply. Data deletion exceptions can include retaining data that is required for service delivery, legal and regulatory reasons, or financial reporting [2]. Data retention and purge are more focused on deleting data according to an organization’s schedules and internal process guidelines. This requires organizations to operate a dedicated data retention governance team to provide data retention and purge oversight in order to deal with ethical and privacy issues. A  sustainable data deletion program can help organizations improve their compliance with applicable privacy and data protection requirements as well as enhance data governance and data protection posture at the same time [2].

## Continuous Fairness Monitoring of ML Models:
ML fairness and monitoring are increasingly becoming critical components of machine learning in the wake of demands for equity and diversity in AI products. ML practitioners generally regard monitoring for drift as an early warning system for performance issues and evaluating models with fairness metrics as a solution for assessing bias in a trained model [1]. A trained model that is fair can become unfair after deployment due to the same model drift that causes performance issues [1]. A method to measure and monitor fairness in ML models over the model lifecycle is Quantile Demographic Drift (QDD) [2]. QDD is a novel model bias quantification metric that uses quantile binning to measure differences in the overall prediction distributions over subgroups [2].  QDD is incorporated into a continuous model monitoring system, called FairCanary, that reuses existing explanations computed for each individual prediction to quickly compute explanations for the QDD bias metrics [2]. When unfairness is detected, a bias mitigation strategy replaces the score of the disadvantaged group with the score of the corresponding rank in the advantaged group [2]. As this approach is a post processing step, it avoids pretraining to debias the model and is therefore a computationally inexpensive approach to bias mitigation [2]. More information about continous fairness monitoring can be found in this paper here (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07057)

## Practical Ways of Mitigating Biases in the Use of the Output (Misuse, Misaligned use, and Misinterpretation of the Output):
AI developers who develop ML models in order to mitigate biases in the output can follow the suggestions to include a “model facts label”, i.e., a 1-page of relevant and actionable information to ensure that front-line users know how, when, how not to use the output [1]. The model facts label can include a short summary about the AI system, the working mechanism (including the source and baseline characteristics of data used for AI development), results of validation studies, guidelines for use (including benefits and appropriate decision support), warnings (including potential risks and consequences), and other relevant information related to the AI system [1]. 
Another practical technical way of mitigating bias is to use the eqaulized odds post-processing. This is a post-processing technique that solves a linear program to find probabilities with which to change output labels to optimize equalized odds [2]. A Python implementation of this technique can be found here (https://aif360.readthedocs.io/en/v0.2.3/modules/postprocessing.html)
